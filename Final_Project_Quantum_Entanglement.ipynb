    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project we will research entangled states. First we will create Bell states and research the correlations of these states. After that we will create partially entangled states and see how these correlations change. Then to simulate reality we will create Bell states with small errors.\n",
    "After we have a better understanding of quantum entanglement we will look at the time dynamics of entangled states. We will focus on what the time dynamics of the Heisenberg XXX model look like, and how the coupling parameter affects the system. Then we will look into the effect of applying an Ising XX gate on a state, and investigate the results we see. This is useful since we now can create arbitrary entangled states using these coupling interactions. This is useful in the field of quantum computing and communication.\n"
